"""Theory of mind: belief tuples (believer, S, R, O).

A model passes a (very weak) theory-of-mind test if it can distinguish:
  - the world's ground truth: "Paris IS the capital of France"
  - a particular agent's belief:  "Bob THINKS the capital of France is Lyon"

Ground truth lives in the standard relational memory (3-tuple S/R/O).
Beliefs are stored with an extra "B" (believer) role, making them
4-tuples that don't pollute the ground-truth memory:

    store_belief("bob", "france", "capital", "lyon")
    -> {B: bob, S: france, R: capital, O: lyon}

Query patterns:
  - ground_truth(S, R)         -> O
  - what_does_x_think(B, S, R) -> O
  - everyone_who_believes(S, R, O) -> list of believers

This is the substrate for false-belief tasks (Sally-Anne, etc.) and
for any agent that needs to track distinct mental models of other
agents alongside its own world model.
