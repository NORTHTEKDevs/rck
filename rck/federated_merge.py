"""Federated KB merge.

Combine two agents' auxiliary state (provenance, skills, KB) into
a single target agent. Useful when two RCK agents have been trained
on disjoint domains and we want a unified one.

What this module merges:
  * HRR knowledge bases (via RelationalMemory.merge, which is HRR-
    additive: bipolar bundle sum)
  * ProvenanceStore (per-fact metadata is summed: count, last_seen
    take the max, source becomes "multi" if they disagree)
  * SkillLibrary (success / failure counters add)

What it does NOT merge:
  * QueryMemory (episode logs are typically agent-specific)
  * Chain cache (different topologies invalidate it anyway)
  * Calibration tally (per-agent metacognitive measurements)
